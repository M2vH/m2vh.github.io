## About me

I'm a `Software Craftsman`-Junior.  
With every line my code will become more `clean`, `solid` and `test-driven`.

My languages are `C#` and `C++`.

For development I'm using `Visual Studio [Code]`, `GitHub` and `Azure [DevOps]`.

I feel comfortable inside the `.NET Framework`. I have experiences in writing `Desktop Apps` using `WPF` and `UWP`, writing code for the `Unity3D` game engine and understand the concept of `DirectX 12`. 

At the moment I'm following the ☁ `Azure DevOps Engineer Expert`-Path on `Microsoft Learning`.
