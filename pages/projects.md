# A collection of coding samples

This is a collection of some of my other repositories. The collection is evolving while I reorganize my repositories.

### Gaming with Console

#### Description

`Gaming with Console` (Spielen mit Console) is a C# Console Application. 
The goal of this project was to explore the possibilities and borders of `Console` Applications.

Feel free to visit the projects [repository page](https://m2vh.github.io/SpielenMitConsole/).

#### Highlights

Remembering the time as a graphic designer and inspired by the `ascii art` I wanted to use `System.Console` as a paint board. To make the `monster` running seperately I created them inside different `Threads` and learned a lot about the `lock` in `Multithreading`.

#### Critics

Knowing nearly nothing about the `SOLID` principles and the `Game Loop Concept` the codebase is hard to follow, even harder to maintain. I keep this as a starting point for a `Day of Code`-project. And because I like `Angro`, the green `Ascii Monster`
